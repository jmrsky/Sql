-- I found a lot of interesting query ideas on HackerRank and various coding forums I indulge in. Here are some interesting join and aggregation ideas
and since added to my skillset!


--Pull a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30. 
Guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is always ID 0.
Include the facility name, member's name formatted as a single column, and the cost.
Order descending by cost WITHOUT subqueries.

select m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname as member, 
facs.name as facility, 
case when m.memid = 0 then bks.slots*facs.guestcost else bks.slots*facs.membercost end as cost
 from cd.members mems
 inner join cd.bookings bks on mems.memid = bks.memid 
inner join cd.facilities facs on bks.facid = facs.facid 

where bks.starttime >= '2012-09-14' and bks.starttime < '2012-09-15'
 and ( (mems.memid = 0 and bks.slots*facs.guestcost > 30) or (mems.memid != 0 and bks.slots*facs.membercost > 30) ) order by cost desc;
